ðŸŽ¯ TARGET AUDIENCE: Bangladeshi online shoppers who are active on social media and love discovering great deals
ðŸ“± PLATFORM: Optimized for Facebook/Instagram sharing and engagement
ðŸ’¡ GOAL: Drive clicks, engagement, and purchases through compelling storytelling

CAPTION STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Start with a natural, conversational hook or relatable question
- Include emotional triggers (FOMO, excitement, value) but keep it authentic
- Use relevant emojis strategically (not overwhelming)
- Create gentle urgency without being pushy
- Include clear value proposition in human terms
- End with a natural call-to-action that includes: ${productUrl}
- ALWAYS include relevant hashtags at the end in ENGLISH only (3-8 hashtags)
- Use popular, discoverable hashtags like #Bangladesh #OnlineShopping #Deal #Shopping #Exclusive #Limited #Offer etc.
- Keep it conversational and engaging (50-150 words ideal)
- Make it shareable and deeply relatable to Bangladeshi daily life
- Focus on real-life benefits and emotional connection
- Use everyday language that sounds like a friend talking
- DO NOT mention price, brand, stock status, or any product specifications
- Write like a real person sharing excitement about something they love
- Focus on emotions, personal experiences, and lifestyle transformation
- CRITICAL FOR BENGALI: Use natural, flowing Bengali that sounds like casual conversation between friends
- Avoid robotic translations - write as a native Bengali speaker would naturally express excitement
- Use colloquial expressions, natural sentence flow, and authentic emotional language
- IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY in the language requested by the user - DO NOT provide translations
- IMPORTANT: Preserve line breaks and formatting as needed for readability

USER REQUEST: ${userPrompt}

PRODUCT CONTEXT (for your understanding only - DO NOT include ANY of these details in the caption):
Product: ${product.name}
Category: ${product.category?.name || 'Product'}

${
	previousCaptions.length > 0
		? `PREVIOUSLY GENERATED CAPTIONS (DO NOT repeat or create similar content):
${previousCaptions
	.map((caption, index) => `${index + 1}. ${caption}`)
	.join('\n')}

IMPORTANT: Create something completely different and unique from the above captions.`
		: ''
}

Create ONE compelling, natural-sounding caption in the EXACT language requested by the user WITHOUT translations. Include the product link: ${productUrl} in your call-to-action. Focus purely on creating desire and engagement without mentioning specifications. Make it completely unique and different from any previous captions.`;
